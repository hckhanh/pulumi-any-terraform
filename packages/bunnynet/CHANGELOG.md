## 0.11.0 (2025-10-28)

### üöÄ Features

- ### Backwards compatibility break ([577fc2a](https://github.com/hckhanh/pulumi-any-terraform/commit/577fc2a))

  The resource `compute_container_app` now uses a [list type](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/framework/handling-data/types/list) to define `container`, `endpoint` and `env` blocks. While both set and list types are compatible at the [state](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/state) level, this change has some limitations:

  #### Limitations

  - `container`, `endpoint` and `env` blocks have to sorted by `name`. You'll need to follow the same order on your .tf files, otherwise terraform will show them as modified after an `apply`;
  - Renaming a `container`, `endpoint` or `env` will cause the plan to show unrelated items being modified, as their order jumps up or down. We recommend deleting the block, applying, and then adding the block again with the new name;
  - Renaming an `endpoint` of type CDN might cause pullzones to be recreated, even if they aren't directly affected;

  #### Upgrade path

  1. Make sure `terraform plan` reports no changes;
  2. Upgrade the bunny.net provider;
  3. Sort the `container`, `endpoint` and `env` blocks in your .tf files;
  4. Add `version = 2` to your `bunnynet_compute_container_app` resources;
  5. Run `terraform plan`, it should report no changes apart from the `version` attribute;

  #### Motivation

  While the [set type](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/framework/handling-data/types/set) would be the semantically correct type to use for those blocks, Terraform's implementation is neither complete nor uses the same internal details as the List type. This means that changing attributes in a sub-block often causes the entire `container` to be replaced, causing endpoints to be re-created, including their pullzones. It is also not possible to reference set objects in `lifecycle.ignore_changes`.

### üöÄ Features

- This minor release adds new DNS script functionality and enhances existing DNS record capabilities in the Bunny.net Pulumi provider by: ([#53](https://github.com/hckhanh/pulumi-any-terraform/pull/53))

  1. **New DNS Script Resources**: Added support for DNS scripts and their environment variables for advanced DNS management
  2. **Enhanced DNS Record Management**: Improved DNS record properties with pullzone linking and API alignment

## 0.8.7 (2025-08-26)

### ü©π Fixes

- This patch release addresses a critical bug in the bunnynet provider and improves the development workflow configuration. ([#35](https://github.com/hckhanh/pulumi-any-terraform/pull/35))

  **Primary Fix: Pullzone Cache Expiration Time Bug**
  - Fixed an issue where the `cache_expiration_time` property in the pullzone resource was generating invalid new values during resource updates
  - This bug was causing Terraform operations to fail when attempting to modify pullzone configurations
  - The fix involved correcting the value handling logic to ensure proper validation and serialization of cache expiration time values
  - This resolves potential runtime errors and ensures smooth resource lifecycle management for pullzone resources
  **Development Workflow Enhancement**
  - Enabled version plans in the Nx release configuration to improve the release management process
  - This change allows for better tracking and planning of version bumps across the monorepo
  - Enhances the automated release workflow by providing more granular control over versioning decisions
  - Supports better collaboration by making version planning more transparent and predictable
  **Additional Improvements**
  - Updated multiple TypeScript resource definitions to ensure consistency and improve type safety
  - Standardized formatting and code structure across all bunnynet provider resources
  - Enhanced resource property definitions for better documentation and IntelliSense support
  - Improved the overall developer experience when working with the bunnynet provider
  This release ensures that existing pullzone resources continue to work correctly while providing a more robust foundation for future development and releases.
