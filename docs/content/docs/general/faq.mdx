Common questions and answers about Pulumi Any Terraform providers.

## General Questions

### What is Pulumi Any Terraform?

Pulumi Any Terraform is a collection of dynamically bridged Pulumi providers that enable you to use Terraform providers within the Pulumi ecosystem. It automatically converts Terraform providers into fully-typed Pulumi packages with complete TypeScript support.

### How is this different from using Terraform directly?

While Terraform uses HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language), Pulumi lets you use real programming languages like TypeScript, Python, Go, and C#. This means:
- Full IDE support with IntelliSense
- Type safety and compile-time checks
- Real programming constructs (loops, conditionals, functions)
- Better code reusability and modularity
- Native integration with existing codebases

### How is this different from regular Pulumi providers?

Regular Pulumi providers are built specifically for Pulumi. These bridged providers use Pulumi's bridge to automatically convert existing Terraform providers, giving you access to the vast Terraform ecosystem within Pulumi.

### Is this production-ready?

Yes! The bridge technology is mature and used by many Pulumi users in production. However, the stability of each provider depends on the underlying Terraform provider quality.

## Installation & Setup

### Which package manager should I use?

Any of npm, yarn, or pnpm will work. The project itself uses pnpm for development, but you can use whichever you prefer:

```bash
npm install pulumi-namecheap
# or
yarn add pulumi-namecheap
# or
pnpm add pulumi-namecheap
```

### Do I need to install Terraform?

No! The Terraform provider runtime is embedded in each Pulumi package. You only need Pulumi CLI and Node.js.

### Can I use these providers with other Pulumi providers?

Absolutely! You can mix and match any Pulumi providers in the same program:

```typescript
import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
import * as namecheap from "pulumi-namecheap";

const instance = new aws.ec2.Instance(/* ... */);
const record = new namecheap.Record(/* ... */);
```

### What versions of Pulumi are supported?

These providers require Pulumi 3.190.0 or later. We recommend using the latest stable version.

### What Node.js version do I need?

Node.js 18.0 or later is recommended. The project is developed with Node.js 22.18.0.

## Usage Questions

### How do I find provider documentation?

1. Check this documentation site for provider guides
2. Refer to the original Terraform provider documentation
3. Use TypeScript IntelliSense in your IDE
4. Check the provider's README in the package

### Can I import existing resources?

Yes! Use Pulumi's import command:

```bash
pulumi import namecheap:index:Record www domain.com/www/A
```

### How do I handle secrets?

Use Pulumi's built-in secret management:

```bash
pulumi config set provider:apiKey value --secret
```

Or in code:

```typescript
import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";

const config = new pulumi.Config();
const apiKey = config.requireSecret("apiKey");
```

### Can I use these providers in multiple languages?

Currently, these packages are published for TypeScript/JavaScript. Support for Python, Go, and C# could be added in the future.

### How do I update a provider?

Update the package version:

```bash
npm update pulumi-namecheap
```

Then run your program:

```bash
pulumi preview
pulumi up
```

## Technical Questions

### How does the bridge work?

The bridge uses Pulumi's `pulumi-terraform-bridge` to:
1. Read the Terraform provider's schema
2. Generate Pulumi resource definitions
3. Create TypeScript type definitions
4. Map Terraform operations to Pulumi lifecycle

See the [Architecture](/docs/architecture) guide for details.

### What happens to my Terraform state?

You don't use Terraform state files. Pulumi manages its own state, which can be:
- Stored in Pulumi Cloud (default)
- Self-hosted in S3, Azure Blob, GCS, or local files

### Can I migrate from Terraform to these providers?

Yes, but you'll need to:
1. Convert HCL to TypeScript
2. Import existing resources into Pulumi state
3. Test thoroughly before production

### Are there any limitations?

Some Terraform features don't translate perfectly:
- Terraform modules don't exist (use TypeScript functions instead)
- Some Terraform-specific syntax doesn't apply
- Provider-specific quirks may exist

### How are resources named?

Resources use Pulumi's naming:
- Resource name: Logical name in your code
- Physical name: Auto-generated or explicit
- URN: Unique Pulumi identifier

### Can I use Terraform providers not in this collection?

Yes! You can create your own bridged provider by:
1. Creating a new package structure
2. Configuring the parameterization
3. Following the [Contributing Guide](/docs/contributing)

## Performance Questions

### Are these providers slower than native Pulumi?

The bridge adds minimal overhead. Most time is spent in:
- API calls to target services
- Network latency
- Resource creation/update time

### How can I speed up deployments?

1. Use `--parallel` flag for concurrent operations
2. Split large stacks into smaller ones
3. Use stack references for dependencies
4. Enable Pulumi state caching

### Do these providers support preview/dry-run?

Yes! `pulumi preview` shows what will change before applying.

## Troubleshooting Questions

### My provider isn't working. What do I check?

1. Verify credentials are configured correctly
2. Check API access and IP whitelists
3. Enable debug logging: `pulumi up -v=9`
4. Review the [Troubleshooting Guide](/docs/troubleshooting)

### I'm getting type errors. How do I fix them?

1. Ensure TypeScript version is compatible
2. Regenerate type definitions if needed
3. Check for type mismatches in your code
4. Use `pulumi.Input<T>` for inputs

### How do I debug provider issues?

Enable debug logging:

```bash
export PULUMI_DEBUG_COMMANDS=true
export TF_LOG=DEBUG
pulumi up -v=9
```

### Resources aren't updating. Why?

1. Run `pulumi refresh` to sync state
2. Check for manual changes outside Pulumi
3. Verify update is allowed by provider
4. Review resource protection settings

## Development Questions

### How do I contribute a new provider?

Follow the [Contributing Guide](/docs/contributing):
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new package
3. Configure parameterization
4. Submit a pull request

### Can I modify generated code?

No! Generated code is overwritten on rebuild. Instead:
- Use wrapper functions
- Create helper modules
- Extend with TypeScript classes

### How do I test my changes?

1. Build the provider locally
2. Link to a test program: `pnpm link`
3. Run `pulumi preview` and `pulumi up`
4. Verify resources in provider dashboard

### How do I report bugs?

1. Check [existing issues](https://github.com/hckhanh/pulumi-any-terraform/issues)
2. Create a new issue with:
   - Provider and version
   - Error message
   - Minimal reproduction code

## Licensing Questions

### What license is this project under?

MIT License. See the LICENSE file for details.

### Can I use this commercially?

Yes! MIT license allows commercial use.

### Are there any restrictions?

The MIT license requires:
- Include copyright notice
- Include license text

### What about the Terraform providers?

Each Terraform provider has its own license. Check the provider's repository for details.

## Cost Questions

### Are these providers free?

The Pulumi packages are free and open source. However:
- Target services may have costs (API usage, resources)
- Pulumi Cloud has free and paid tiers
- Consider resource costs in your planning

### Do I need a Pulumi subscription?

No for basic usage. Pulumi offers:
