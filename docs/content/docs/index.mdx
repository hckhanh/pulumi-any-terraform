# Pulumi Any Terraform

Welcome to the Pulumi Any Terraform documentation! This project provides seamless integration between Terraform providers and Pulumi, allowing you to leverage the extensive Terraform provider ecosystem while enjoying Pulumi's modern infrastructure-as-code experience.

## What is Pulumi Any Terraform?

Pulumi Any Terraform is a collection of **dynamically bridged Pulumi providers** that automatically converts Terraform providers into fully-typed Pulumi packages. This means you can:

- Use any Terraform provider with Pulumi's state management
- Get complete TypeScript/JavaScript type safety
- Enjoy native integration with Pulumi's deployment engine
- Stay automatically synced with upstream Terraform providers

## Key Features

### 🔄 Full Terraform Compatibility
Use any Terraform provider with Pulumi without manual conversion. The bridge automatically handles the translation between Terraform's schema and Pulumi's resource model.

### 📘 Type Safety
Complete TypeScript definitions for all resources, inputs, and outputs. Get IntelliSense, auto-completion, and compile-time type checking.

### 🌍 Multi-Language Support
Generated providers work with TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Go, and C#. Write infrastructure code in your preferred language.

### ⚡ Dynamic Updates
Automatically stay in sync with upstream Terraform providers. No manual regeneration needed when providers update.

### 🎯 Native Pulumi Experience
Full integration with Pulumi's state management, stack outputs, secrets, and deployment engine. All Pulumi features work seamlessly.
