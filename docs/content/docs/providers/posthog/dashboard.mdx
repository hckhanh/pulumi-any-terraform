The Dashboard resource allows you to create and manage custom dashboards for visualizing analytics data in PostHog.

## Example Usage

### Basic Dashboard

```typescript
import * as posthog from "pulumi-posthog";

const dashboard = new posthog.Dashboard("analytics", {
    name: "Product Analytics",
    description: "Key metrics for product performance",
});
```

### Pinned Dashboard

```typescript
const pinnedDashboard = new posthog.Dashboard("main-dashboard", {
    name: "Main Metrics Dashboard",
    description: "Primary dashboard for daily monitoring",
    pinned: true,
});
```

### Dashboard with Multiple Insights

```typescript
import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
import * as posthog from "pulumi-posthog";

// Create insights
const signupInsight = new posthog.Insight("signups", {
    name: "User Signups",
    queryJson: JSON.stringify({
        kind: "TrendsQuery",
        series: [{
            kind: "EventsNode",
            event: "user_signed_up",
            name: "User Signed Up",
        }],
        dateRange: {
            date_from: "-30d",
        },
    }),
});

const pageviewInsight = new posthog.Insight("pageviews", {
    name: "Pageviews",
    queryJson: JSON.stringify({
        kind: "TrendsQuery",
        series: [{
            kind: "EventsNode",
            event: "$pageview",
            name: "Pageviews",
        }],
        dateRange: {
            date_from: "-7d",
        },
    }),
});

// Create dashboard
const dashboard = new posthog.Dashboard("overview", {
    name: "Weekly Overview",
    description: "Weekly metrics overview",
    pinned: true,
});

// Add insights to dashboard (done via Insight resource)
const signupWithDash = new posthog.Insight("signup-on-dash", {
    name: "Signups",
    dashboardIds: [12345], // Reference dashboard ID
    queryJson: JSON.stringify({
        kind: "TrendsQuery",
        series: [{
            kind: "EventsNode",
            event: "user_signed_up",
        }],
        dateRange: { date_from: "-30d" },
    }),
});
```

### Team Dashboard

```typescript
const teamDashboard = new posthog.Dashboard("team-metrics", {
    name: "Engineering Team Metrics",
    description: "Performance and adoption metrics for the engineering team",
});
```

## Resource Properties

### Optional Arguments

- `name` (string): Dashboard name
- `description` (string): Dashboard description
- `pinned` (boolean): Pin to top of dashboard list

### Attributes

- `id`: Dashboard ID
- `name`: Dashboard name
- `description`: Dashboard description
- `pinned`: Whether the dashboard is pinned

## Best Practices

### 1. Descriptive Names

Use clear, descriptive names for dashboards:

```typescript
// ✅ Good
const dashboard = new posthog.Dashboard("customer-health", {
    name: "Customer Health Metrics",
    description: "Track user engagement and retention",
});

// ❌ Avoid
const dashboard = new posthog.Dashboard("dash1", {
    name: "Dashboard 1",
});
```

### 2. Pin Important Dashboards

Pin frequently accessed dashboards for quick access:

```typescript
const mainDashboard = new posthog.Dashboard("main", {
    name: "Main Dashboard",
    pinned: true, // Shows at top
});
```

### 3. Organize by Theme

Group related metrics in themed dashboards:

```typescript
// User engagement dashboard
const engagement = new posthog.Dashboard("engagement", {
    name: "User Engagement",
    description: "Daily active users, session length, feature usage",
});

// Business metrics dashboard
const business = new posthog.Dashboard("business", {
    name: "Business Metrics",
    description: "Signups, conversions, revenue tracking",
});

// Product health dashboard
const health = new posthog.Dashboard("health", {
    name: "Product Health",
    description: "Error rates, performance, uptime",
});
```

## Common Use Cases

### Executive Dashboard

High-level metrics for leadership:

```typescript
const executive = new posthog.Dashboard("executive", {
    name: "Executive Summary",
    description: "Key business metrics and growth indicators",
    pinned: true,
});
```

### Product Team Dashboard

Metrics for product development:

```typescript
const product = new posthog.Dashboard("product-metrics", {
    name: "Product Team Metrics",
    description: "Feature adoption, user feedback, A/B test results",
});
```

### Operations Dashboard

Operational and technical metrics:

```typescript
const ops = new posthog.Dashboard("operations", {
    name: "Operations Dashboard",
    description: "System health, error rates, performance metrics",
});
```

## Troubleshooting

### Dashboard Not Visible

**Issue**: Dashboard doesn't appear in PostHog UI

**Solution**:
- Check that the dashboard was created successfully
- Verify you're logged into the correct PostHog project
- Refresh the PostHog UI

### Cannot Add Insights

**Issue**: Insights don't appear on dashboard

**Solution**:
- Insights are added via the Insight resource's `dashboardIds` property
- Use the dashboard's numeric ID (from PostHog) when creating insights
- Ensure the insight and dashboard are in the same project
